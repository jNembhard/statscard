## My process

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was used a refresher for using plain HTML5 and CSS3. I typically am used to coding in React, so using plain HTML definitely changed my go to thought processes.

I typically liked to organize everything with styled-components, but the package was not available in plain HTML format. I had worked to create a css folder with major styles. Overall this challenge wasn't too difficult, but it did remind me that React should not always be a go-to tool. For a simple static page quick HTML is sometimes a better option and lighter weight than a React build.

Some of the downsides can involve rewriting lines of code instead of using mapping functions. On bigger projects it can take a bit longer to figure out what is necessary to change, so it is best to make sure the design is simplistic as possible when using plain HTML and CSS.
